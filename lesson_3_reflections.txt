When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If you are working as part of a remote team or want your code to be available to others
    it would be preferable to keep a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Someone else may have made changes to the remote repository and you may not
    wish to use their changes.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A clone is a local copy of another repository, either local or remote,
    whilst a fork is a clone done via GitHub. A branch is an alternative commit
    history that comes off of the master branch.
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It allows you to work with the latest version of the remote whilst not
    online.
    
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    Using email would be the most obvious way to collaborate without using
    Git or GitHub. It would be easier in that there would be nothing new to
    learn to work this way but it would be more difficult because once a
    number of different versions of a file have been shared it would be harder
    to keep track of them all.
    
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

    When those changes are not ready to go into the master branch yet, eg you
    might be trying out a new feature. It is less complicated to just use the
    master branch but using branches keeps things clearer.
