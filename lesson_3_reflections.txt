When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If you are working as part of a remote team or want your code to be available to others
    it would be preferable to keep a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Someone else may have made changes to the remote repository and you may not
    wish to use their changes.
