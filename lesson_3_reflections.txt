When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    If you are working as part of a remote team or want your code to be available to others
    it would be preferable to keep a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Someone else may have made changes to the remote repository and you may not
    wish to use their changes.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A clone is a local copy of another repository, either local or remote,
    whilst a fork is a clone done via GitHub. A branch is an alternative commit
    history that comes off of the master branch.
